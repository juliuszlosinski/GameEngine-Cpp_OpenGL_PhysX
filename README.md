# GameEngine-Cpp_OpenGL_PhysX
Hi!
This folder contains everything about my game engine that is during the process of realization.
Legend:
* External_Libs ~ contains all external libraries that are used (GLEW and GLFW).
* Repos ~ contains the project with application (Game engine).
* Versions_And_Notes ~ contains all notes written by me and latest versions of game engine.

Goals:
1. Implement rendering system by using OpenGL: 
GLFW for creating the context and handling windows and user inputs. 
GLEW for manipulating the context in a modern way and handling platform depended extensions.
2. Implement physics system by using PhysX from Nvidia.
3. Support audio.

Current progress:

1. Date: 6.08.2021

Creating the window with context using GLFW and initializing GLEW for using modern OpenGL.
